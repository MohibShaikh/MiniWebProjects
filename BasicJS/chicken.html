            <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl">domesticated
                    junglefowl</a> species, with attributes of wild species such
                as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl<sup>[1]</sup> that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster
                or
                cock
                is a term
                for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a
                capon.
                An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
                Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the
                Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[2][3] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
                (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.</p>
            <p>Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7
                billion
                as
                of 2018,[4] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.<sup>5</sup> There are more chickens in the world than
                any
                other
                bird.[5] There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in
                language
                and literature.
                Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East
                Asia,[6]
                but
                the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian
                subcontinent.
                From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century
                BC.[7]
                Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day"
                having
                come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III</p>
